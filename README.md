- After adding it to the search and changing source type to HTTP and to remove duplicate entries and one to list as a table, we will be using "dedup" and "table" keywords from the [Splunk Documentation - Search Reference](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Metadata) . Final query would be:
  ```index="botsv2" sourcetype="stream:HTTP" "10.0.2.101" | dedup site | table site```
